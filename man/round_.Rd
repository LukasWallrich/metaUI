\title{Round function that returns trailing zeroes}
\usage{
round_(x, digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector to be rounded}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits}
}
\value{
Character vector of rounded values, with trailing zeroes as needed to show \code{digits} figures after the decimal point
}
\description{
Particularly when creating tables, it is often desirable to keep
all numbers to the same width. \code{round()} and similar functions drop
trailing zeros - this version keeps them and thus rounds 1.201 to 1.20
rather than 1.2 when 2 digits are requested.
